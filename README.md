# Stacker Game

Video Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAO2CzRwX24

This is my final project for CS120B. This project utilized the  ATMEGA 1284 microprocessor and a 5x8 LED matrix. The objective of the game is to stack the dots to the top of the LED matrix, with each succeeding level moving faster from side to side. The game utilizes PWM for sound effects, including start sounds, button presses, and victory and game over songs. The 8 LEDs on the bottom display the previous score, the current level,  and victory/game over displays (in addition to a 'W' or 'L' displayed on the matrix, respectively).
